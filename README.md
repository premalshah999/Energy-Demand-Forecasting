# Energy-Demand-Forecasting

Energy Demand and Electricity Price Forecasting

This project focuses on forecasting energy demand and electricity prices using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It uses a rigorous dataset of four years of electrical consumption, generation, pricing, and weather data for Spain.


Methodology

The project employs a variety of models, including:

Machine Learning Models:

XGBoost Regressor

Deep Learning/Stacked Models:

Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

CNN-LSTM

LSTM-Attention



Hybrid Methods:

GRU-XGBoost

LSTM-Attention-XGBoost

The models are trained and evaluated on the dataset, and their performance is compared.



Results

The results of the study show that the hybrid models, particularly GRU-XGBoost and LSTM-Attention-XGBoost, demonstrate superior accuracy in forecasting energy demand and electricity prices.




Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the complexities of predictive modeling in the energy sector. The findings emphasize the importance of thoughtful model selection and the potential benefits of combining machine learning and deep learning techniques. 



Future Work
Future work in this domain can leverage these insights to advance the field and achieve enhanced predictive accuracy.
